## Fall 2021, Michigan State University

This is an advanced graduate-level course covering the essentials of radiation processes in astrophysics.

### Course Goals

At the conclusion of this course, you should 

- understand basic concepts of radiation (from Maxwell to light) and radiative transfer
- understand black body radiation
- understand radiation from moving charges
- understand bremsstrahlung
- understand synchrotron radiation
- understand basic concepts of radioactive decay
- understand atomic structure, line emission, photoabsorption, collisional ionization, line diagnostics
- understand molecular structure
- understand emission from molecules

### Instructor information

Dr. Wolfgang Kerzendorf
Assistant Professor  
Office: 3250 Biomedical and Physical Sciences  
Office hours: By appointment  
[wkerzend@msu.edu](mailto:wkerzend@msu.edu)  

### Class meetings

The class meets Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5:00 pm to 6:20 pm in BPS 1300. 

Some necessary materials will be posted http://github.com/wkerzendorf/radiative-processes-2021

### Communication and Slack

The primary vehicle for communication regarding this course will be the internal Astro [Mattermost](https://5fcw2e.stackhero-network.com).
Specifically, there is a `rad-proc-2021` channelworkspace. If you are not part of the workspace yet - please let me know. 

Discussion of course subject material and problems is **strongly** encouraged.
You may also send direct messages via Slack to the instructor or any other member of the workspace.

### Text book and references

See [Resources](resources.rst) in the main folder for a link to resources. See the resources.rst file in each of the lecture subfolders for resources for that specific lecture.


### Assignments

There will be reading and problem sets assigned on a roughly bi-weekly basis. See [Assignments](assignments.md) for a complete listing (forthcoming 2nd week of class). See the resources.rst in each folder for the assigned watching of videos and reading. You will be expected to complete the reading _prior_ to class as not _all_ the reading material will be covered in lecture, but you _will_ need to know it in order to complete the problems. 

Group work on the problem sets is encouraged and you are encouraged to turn in the problem sets with a maximum of 3 names assigned. No rule of scholarly activity is more important than giving proper credit to the contributions of others. Although you are free to work with classmates on assignments, you must explicitly acknowledge them by name and indicate their contributions in your final write-up. 

### Schedule

The schedule is Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5.00 - 6.20. 

### Projects

You will be required to complete a final project for the course. The final projects will be done alone. See [Projects](numerical_project.md) for forthcoming details. 

### Final exam

There will be no final exam but you will be required to make a presentation about your final project.

### Grading policy

The weights for the course grade are as follows.

Category                   | %
-------------------------- | ---
Problem sets               | 40%
Final project              | 50%
In-class participation     | 10%

The final course grade will be assigned based on the following scale.

Grade        | Overall %
------------ | ----------
4.0          | >=90
3.5          | >=83
3.0          | >=76
2.5          | >=68
2.0          | >=62
1.5          | >=55
1.0          | >=45

Your final grade will be no lower than that indicated on the above scale, though it _may_ be higher, depending on overall class performance.


### Spartan Code of Honor Academic Pledge

As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do.
